# VIVICT - Vivict Video Comparison Tool

An easy to use in-browser tool for subjective comparison of the visual quality of different encodings of the same video source.

![](docs/screenshot.png?raw=true "vivict screenshot")

## Getting started
Go to https://vivictorg.github.io/vivict/. By default, it will open a HLS test stream from [Sintel](https://durian.blender.org/) video in different bitrates.


## Usage

The screen is split into two parts, with the left and right part displaying the left and right video source. The split position will follow the mouse, so moving the mouse to the left will show more of the right source and vice versa.

#### Selecting sources

On the top left and right are the source selectors, allowing you to select sources for the left and right video 
respectively. You can either input a URL or open a local file. If the source is a HLS-playlist, you can also select which video stream you want to view.

#### URL parameters

If you want to programmatically change the sources or the playback position, you can use the following URL parameters:

- `leftVideoUrl` – sets the left video source
- `rightVideoUrl` – sets the right video source
- `leftVideoVariant` – sets the left video HLS variant
- `rightVideoVariant` – sets the right video HLS variant
- `position` – sets the start position in seconds
- `hideHelp` – if 1, hides the automatic help menu
- `hideSourceSelector` – if 1, hides the source selection menu

To use the parameters, you have to URL-encode the source URL. For example, to load the videos `http://example.com/test1.mp4` and `http://example.com/test2.mp4`, open the following URL:

```
http://localhost:3000/?leftVideoUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Ftest1.mp4&rightVideoUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Ftest2.mp4
```

<kbd>k</kbd> Pause video  
<kbd>space</kbd> Play/Pause video  
<kbd>,</kbd> Step forward 1 frame  
<kbd>,</kbd> Step backward 1 frame  
<kbd>/</kbd> or <kbd>-</kbd>  Step forward 1 second  
<kbd>m</kbd> Step backward 1 second

If you think the shortcuts could be better, feel free to suggest a setup!

## Supported codecs and container formats

Depends on the browser. mp4 and h264 should generally work. h265 should work in safari.
 AV1 works in firefox.

HLS is supported through [hls.js](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js/)
 
MPEG-DASH is supported through [dash.js](https://github.com/video-dev/dash.js/)

## Supported browsers

Vivict has been tested in Chrome. Firefox should also.

## Running locally

Vivict can be run locally by checking out the source code and running

```
    npm install
    npm start

```
Note: you might also need to install a few peer dependencies.
 
There is also a C++-based version of offline use available here: https://github.com/vivictorg/vivictpp
